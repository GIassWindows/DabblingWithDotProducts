# Dot Products

A dot product is the sum of two vectors' corresponding X, Y, Z vectors. 
It is incredibly useful to find the closest angle between these two vectors. 

# How to find the dot product of two vectors

To find the dot product of two vectors, we first need two vectors (of course).

For this example, I will be using the vectors:
```
A = {2, 4, 6}
B = {1, 3 ,5}
```

Now, we need to multiply the corresponding X, Y, Z vectors by each other and get the sum of the result. Like so:

```
DotProduct = (2 * 1) + (4 * 3) + (6 * 5)
```

The result should be 44.

# Equation

```
A = {X1, Y1, Z1}
B = {X2, Y2, Z2}

Sum = (X1 * X2) + (Y2 * Y2) + (Z1 * Z2)
```
